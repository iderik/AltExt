### Code
#####

# Get data from all connected players when starting script
I'll have to wait for Lamster (developer of Altitude) to update the "listPlayers" first.

# Log rotation at 4mb
If currFileSize < prevFileSize, do read "log_old.txt" from prevPos and then set prevPos to 0 and immediatly read from the new log file.

### Bugs
#####

# Escape characters in name (maybe possible)
If a player has a escapecharacter in the nickname, there might be some undefined behaveiur. I dont think it will effect any crucial parts of the system, but only when the nickname is printed as an output, for example to a terminal stdout. Nothing serious, but it needs to be tested.

# Commands

When you're about to execute a command, remember to exclude quotes (") and arrows (< or >) from the command. If you leave <playerName> blank on most commands, it will use your own playername as argument. This is to make it easier to run commands against yourself, for example: "/Plr.Info".

# Access flags

Any flag can be added or removed from a player, this is not common because group (see below) are faster and safer to use.



# Access groups

When a player is added to a group, all the related flags will be removed from the player. This is done because there shouldnt be any left over flags if the player is removed from a group.
